RUNIN
Runaway Indicator

Purpose

This document specifies software requirements of the Runaway Indicator (runin) software module. The module is developed and deployed in the European Transport Solver (ETS) framework maintained by the Code Development for Integrated Modelling Project (ITM) of the EUROfusion consortium (https://portal.eufus.eu/itm/portal/).

Product Scope

The Runaway Indicator (runin) project supplies a simulator module assembled as a Kepler workflow actor, which is capable of indicating whether runaway electron generation is to be expected during tokamak operation. This functionality is highly valuable in ITM simulations, since present equilibrium and transport calculations neglect the generation of runaway electrons. The runin module can determine whether runaways are generated thus validate the results of equilibrium and transport modules in this manner.

References

Runaway Indicator is maintained under a Github repository dedicated to runaway electron physics. The project’s basic description, documentation and source code is stored in the Github project https://github.com/osrep.

Analytical formula used to determine the critical electric field is based on the work of J.W. Connor and R.J. Hastie[1]. The method of calculating Dreicer runaway generation growth rate stems from the article of H. Dreicer[2].

The current status of runaway electron modelling in ETS has been published in Nuclear Fusion in 2019 [3].
